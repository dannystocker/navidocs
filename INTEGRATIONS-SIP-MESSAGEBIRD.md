### 2.2 Conversation State Management

#### Active Conversation Lifecycle
```
New Contact Message
    ↓
[Conversation Created] → Messages Flow
    ↓
[Active State] → Receive/Send Messages
    ↓
[Archive Decision] → /archive endpoint triggered
    ↓
[Archived State] → No new messages accepted (conversation locked)
    ↓
Customer Re-initiates Contact
    ↓
[New Conversation Created] → Fresh conversation thread
```

This enables:
- **Ticketing Workflows:** Archive = ticket closed
- **Session Management:** One active conversation per customer
- **Multi-Team Routing:** Different teams handle conversations
- **Conversation History:** Permanent archive of all communications

### 2.3 Channel Switching & Fallback Strategy

MessageBird's intelligent fallback system ensures message delivery even if primary channel fails:

#### WhatsApp → SMS Fallback
```
Send WhatsApp Message
    ├─ Success (Delivered) → Complete
    └─ Failure/Timeout
         ├─ Wait X seconds (configurable, default 60s)
         ├─ Send SMS as fallback
         └─ Customer receives notification via SMS
```

**Configuration via Conversations API:**
- Set fallback channel when initiating message send
- Configure fallback delay (default 1 minute)
- Automatic retry handling
- Status tracking for both send attempts

**Business Logic Benefits:**
1. **Maximum Reach:** WhatsApp preferred (rich experience), SMS backup (universal)
2. **Cost Optimization:** WhatsApp at $0.0147/msg vs SMS at $0.008/msg - fallback to cheaper channel
3. **Reliability:** ~99.5% effective reach rate combining both channels
4. **User Preference:** Respects channel preference, intelligent routing

#### Current Fallback Support
- WhatsApp ↔ SMS (bidirectional)
- Future expansion planned for additional channel pairs
- Customizable timeout windows
- Flow Builder integration for complex routing logic

### 2.4 Message Threading & Conversation Continuity

**Unified Message History:**
All messages from a customer across all channels appear in chronological order:
```
Conversation Thread: John Smith
├─ Jan 1, 10:00 AM - SMS: "What's my order status?"
├─ Jan 1, 10:05 AM - SMS Reply: "Your order #12345 is shipping today"
├─ Jan 2, 2:30 PM - WhatsApp: "I haven't received my package yet"
├─ Jan 2, 2:35 PM - WhatsApp Reply: "Let me check tracking..."
├─ Jan 2, 3:00 PM - Email: "Tracking update sent to your email"
├─ Jan 3, 9:00 AM - Telegram: "When should I expect delivery?"
└─ Jan 3, 9:15 AM - Telegram Reply: "By Jan 5th, tracking shows..."
```

**Advantages:**
- **Context Awareness:** Support agents see full history
- **Reduced Repeat Explanations:** Customer doesn't repeat information
- **Cross-Channel Continuity:** Seamless handoff between channels
- **Data Integrity:** Single source of truth for all communications
- **Compliance:** Complete audit trail for regulatory requirements

### 2.5 Chatbot & Automation Integration

Flow Builder enables sophisticated chatbot scenarios:

**Typical Chatbot Flow:**
```

    ↓
Flow Triggered (SMS/WhatsApp/Email)
    ↓
[Classification Node] - Intent detection
    ├─ Order Status Query
    ├─ Return Request
    ├─ Technical Support
    └─ General Inquiry
    ↓
[Conditional Branching]
    ├─ [Order Status] → Query Order DB → Send Status
    ├─ [Return] → Initiate Return Flow → Escalate to Agent
    ├─ [Tech Support] → Knowledge Base Lookup → Send Article Link
    └─ [General] → FAQ Matching → Route to Agent if no match
    ↓
[Response] - Send Reply (same channel or fallback)

### 5.2 Intelligent Routing Architecture

#### Message Routing Decision Tree

```
Send Message Request
    │
    ├─ [Phase 1: Input Validation]
    │  ├─ Phone number format valid? (HLR Lookup if uncertain)
    │  ├─ Contact exists in system?
    │  ├─ Customer opted-in? (GDPR/TCPA compliance)
    │  └─ Message within allowed times? (TCPA 8 AM - 9 PM)
    │
    ├─ [Phase 2: Channel Selection]
    │  ├─ Check customer.preferredChannel
    │  ├─ Check message.suggestedChannel
    │  ├─ If WhatsApp preferred:
    │  │  ├─ Is customer WhatsApp user?
    │  │  └─ Yes → Try WhatsApp with SMS fallback
    │  ├─ Else if Email preferred:
    │  │  └─ Send Email (free, no fallback needed)
    │  └─ Else:
    │     ├─ Cost optimization:
    │     └─ SMS (cheapest reliable)
    │
    ├─ [Phase 3: Message Preparation]
    │  ├─ Format content for channel
    │  ├─ Add fallback instructions if applicable
    │  ├─ Set timeout (default 60s for WhatsApp→SMS)
    │  └─ Prepare webhooks for status tracking
    │
    ├─ [Phase 4: Send Attempt]
    │  ├─ Send to primary channel
    │  ├─ Get immediate queue acknowledgment
    │  ├─ Return messageId to caller
    │  └─ Async delivery in background
    │
    ├─ [Phase 5: Status Tracking]
    │  ├─ Receive channel-specific delivery status
    │  ├─ [If Primary Succeeds]
    │  │  └─ Send webhook: status=delivered
    │  ├─ [If Primary Fails]
    │  │  ├─ Wait timeout seconds
    │  │  ├─ Send to fallback channel
    │  │  └─ Send webhook: status=fallback_sent
    │  └─ [If Both Fail]
    │     └─ Send webhook: status=failed
    │
    └─ [Phase 6: Conversation Update]
       └─ Add message to conversation thread
          ├─ Update last_message_timestamp
          ├─ Update conversation.active status
          └─ Trigger any dependent flows

async function sendSMS(phone, message) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    messagebird.messages.create({
      originator: 'MyCompany',
      body: message,
      recipients: [phone]
    }, (err, response) => {
      if (err) reject(err);
      else resolve(response);
    });
  });
}

// Receive SMS Webhook
app.post('/webhooks/sms', (req, res) => {
  const inboundSMS = {
    id: req.body.id,
    from: req.body.originator,
    message: req.body.body,
    timestamp: req.body.receivedDatetime
  };

  console.log('Inbound SMS:', inboundSMS);

  // Store in database
  // Process message
  // Send response if needed

  res.status(200).send('OK');
});

// Test endpoint
app.get('/test-sms', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const result = await sendSMS('11234567890', 'Test message');
    res.json({ success: true, messageId: result.id });
